# ABM-Simulation
This is a simple simulation example using an Agent Based Modeling (ABM) approach. 
The code simulates a simple airport environment in which new travelers are generated every 30 sec.
The goal is to find the minimum number of tsa agents such that the number of minutes each traveler spends in the airport (from arrival to passing thourgh security gate) is 20 or less.
