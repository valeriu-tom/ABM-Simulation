# ABM-Simulation
This is a simple simulation example using Agent Based Modeling (ABM) approach. 
The code simulates a simple airport environment in which new travalers are generated ever 30 sec.
The goal is to find the min number of tsa agents such that the number of minutes each travaler spends in the airport (from arrrival to passing thourgh security gate) is 20 or less.
